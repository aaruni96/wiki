A wiki is a community driven source of information. It allows large scale collaboration to be able to create a free-for-all easy-access resource of knowledge. Some popularly known wikis are Wikipedia ( http://wikipedia.org ), Arch Linux Wiki ( http://wiki.archlinux.org ) and Ubuntu Wiki ( http://wiki.ubuntu.com ).

"Wiki" (pronounced [Ëˆwiki]) is a Hawaiian word meaning "Quick". It was originally described as "the simplest knowledge database that could possibly work".
